# dgl-lag

symptoms of lag are the 3d not in sync with mapbox map. The mapbox layer 'leads' the 3d.

doesnt do it in demos / previous versions of DeckGL / MapGL

Safari.(sever)
  - shake the viewport around and rotate and the map and 3d become un synced.
  - happens when resizing window downwards.
  - Happens when camera in transit.
  
Chrome / firefox (not so bad but still a problem)
  - lags in camera transit.
  - Lags when resizing window
